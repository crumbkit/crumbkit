## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Row` marks a type that prints as one table row and names its compact
  columns and the columns that `--long` adds.
- `Document` is the typed id of a JSON document, such as
  `shelf/books-list/v1`, and `Document::new` rejects a malformed id at compile
  time.
- `Output` adds the global flags `--json`, `--long`, `--full` and `--fields`
  to a tool's clap parser.
- `finish` prints a result as a text table or as a JSON document with
  `schema` and `data`, and returns the exit code. `finish_to` does the same
  into a `Sink` over any two writers.
